# dtsl-mysql
Date/Time/Strings Libraries (DTSL) for MySQL

DTSL is a date, time, and strings library for MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona Server.

DTSL is a collection of stored functions and procedures for MySQL-compatible systems.

The motivations, use cases, and even justification for the individual components is wildly varied, but there are some common threads.

This project will be published soon... stay tuned.
